- Lambda: Replaces the WebServerVM, handling the app\'s API-based
  processes.

- Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ): Replaces the SQLVM, ensuring high availability
  with built-in replication across availability zones.

- API Gateway: Handles incoming API requests and routes them to the
  Lambda functions.

- Route 53: Manages DNS routing and supports failover between
  availability zones.

- CloudWatch: Provides monitoring and alerting for the system's
  performance.

- VPC and Subnets: Ensures network security and separation of different
  layers.

**Target Architecture Benefits**

By switching to a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, we eliminate
the need to manage servers, which significantly reduces potential
downtime. Lambda automatically scales based on traffic, so if demand
increases or fluctuates, the system can handle it without intervention.
This approach is also more cost-effective because you only pay for what
you use, instead of maintaining servers full-time.

The database will transition to Amazon RDS with multi-AZ replication,
providing robust failover capabilities. Should one availability zone
experience an outage, the system will automatically switch to another
zone, ensuring minimal disruption to the service. RDS also offers
automated backups and regular snapshots to safeguard data integrity.

**Steps in the Migration Process**

1.  **Update the Web Application Code for Better Performance:**

    - Evaluate the current web server and transform the business logic
      into Lambda functions.

    - Set up API Gateway to handle API requests and efficiently direct
      them to the new Lambda-powered backend.

    - Test the Lambda functions to verify they are correctly executing
      the logic and are capable of managing the required workload.

2.  **Transfer the Database:**

    - Migrate the MySQL database from SQLVM to Amazon RDS (MySQL),
      activating multi-AZ replication for high availability.

    - After migration, adjust RDS settings to ensure that failover,
      backups, and automated replication are properly configured.

3.  **Establish Redundancy and Implement Failover Capabilities:**

    - Set up Route 53 for DNS failover, enabling it to automatically
      redirect traffic if the primary region experiences any issues.

    - Configure CloudWatch to monitor the system\'s health and
      efficiency, sending notifications if any problems occur.

    - Ensure the RDS instance is fully backed up, with redundancy in
      place to prevent any data loss.
