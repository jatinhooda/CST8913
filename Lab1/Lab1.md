What are the company's motivators of migration to the cloud?
Unity’s decision to migrate to the cloud was driven by several key factors:
- **Scalability**: Moving to Microsoft Azure allows Unity to support a growing number of users and developers without worrying about performance issues.
- **Faster Troubleshooting**: With AI services like Muse Chat, powered by Azure OpenAI, developers can quickly identify and fix problems without sifting through endless documentation.
- **Partnership Benefits**: By partnering with Microsoft Azure, Unity can extend its reach, making it easier for developers to bring their games to platforms like Windows and Xbox.
- **Enhanced Security**: Azure’s built-in content filtering and AI safety features ensure that Muse Chat remains secure and responsibly used across all projects.
What questions will you ask to understand more about the company infrastructure?
1. What on-premise systems (if any) are currently being used?
2. How much of the infrastructure is already in the cloud?
3. Which cloud providers or services are being utilized?
4. What are the company’s data storage and processing requirements?
5. Are there specific security or compliance standards that must be met?
6. Are there any legacy systems that might make migration more complicated?
7. What does the current development and deployment pipeline look like?

Describe the most likely migration approach that will suit the chosen company.
- **Phased Migration**: By moving smaller, less critical components to the cloud first, Unity can minimize disruptions while ensuring everything works smoothly. This allows for gradual testing and adjustment as each piece of the system transitions.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Unity can also maintain some of its on-prem systems for essential tasks while moving others to the cloud. This gives the company flexibility while it makes the shift and ensures that critical processes aren't interrupted.
Produce a high level schedule for the migration process
 **Weeks 1-2**: Evaluate the current infrastructure and finalize the cloud migration strategy.
- **Weeks 3-5**: Set up the cloud environment (configure Azure infrastructure, networking, and security).
- **Weeks 6-8**: Begin migrating non-critical systems and testing workloads.
- **Weeks 9-10**: Perform detailed testing, including QA and performance benchmarking.
- **Weeks 11-12**: Migrate the core systems and move into full production on the cloud.
- **Weeks 13-14**: Post-migration monitoring, training, and optimization to ensure everything is running smoothly.
What are the main decision criteria for the chosen company?
- **Performance and Reliability**: Azure must deliver the performance and uptime Unity needs to serve its global user base effectively.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ensuring that Azure meets all security and compliance requirements related to game development and data protection is critical.
- **Cost Efficiency**: The costs of running cloud infrastructure will need to be weighed against the benefits.
- **Compatibility with Existing Systems**: Azure services need to integrate well with Unity’s current development pipelines and tools.
- **Scalability**: The cloud solution must be flexible and able to grow with Unity as its needs expand.
